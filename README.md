# What is IoTDevID?


Device identification is one way to secure a network of IoT devices, whereby devices identified as suspicious can subsequently be isolated from a network. In this study, we present a machine learning-based method, *IoTDevID*, that recognises devices through characteristics of their network packets. As a result of using a rigorous feature analysis and selection process, our study offers a generalizable and realistic approach to modelling device behavior, achieving high predictive accuracy across two public datasets. The model's underlying feature set is shown to be more predictive than existing feature sets used for device identification, and is shown to generalise to data unseen during the feature selection process. Unlike most existing approaches to IoT device identification, IoTDevID is able to detect devices using non-IP and low-energy protocols.

# Implementation: 

The implementation phase consists of 5 steps, which are:

* Feature Extraction
* Feature Selection 
* Algorithm Selection 
* Performance Evaluation
* Comparison with Previous Work


Each of these steps is implemented using one or more Python files. The same file was saved with both "py" and "ipynb" extensions. The code they contain is exactly the same. The file with the ipynb extension has the advantage of saving the state of the last run of that file and the screen output. Thus, screen output can be seen without re-running the files. Files with the ipynb extension can be run using [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/install). 









## 01 Feature Extraction (PCAP2CSV) 
#### Section III.C in the article

There are four files relevant to this section:

* [01.1 Aalto feature extraction IoTDevID](https://github.com/kahramankostas/IoTDevIDv2/blob/main/0001%20Feature%20Extraction%20-%20PCAP2CSV/01.1%20Aalto%20feature%20extraction%20IoTDevID.ipynb)
* [01.2 Aalto feature extraction IoTSense - IoT Sentinel](https://github.com/kahramankostas/IoTDevIDv2/blob/main/0001%20Feature%20Extraction%20-%20PCAP2CSV/01.2%20Aalto%20feature%20extraction%20IoTSense-%20IoT%20Sentinel.ipynb)
* [01.3 UNSW feature extraction IoTDevID](https://github.com/kahramankostas/IoTDevIDv2/blob/main/0001%20Feature%20Extraction%20-%20PCAP2CSV/01.3%20UNSW%20feature%20extraction%20IoTDevID.ipynb)
* [01.4 UNSW feature extraction IoTSense - IoT Sentinel](https://github.com/kahramankostas/IoTDevIDv2/blob/main/0001%20Feature%20Extraction%20-%20PCAP2CSV/01.4%20UNSW%20feature%20extraction%20IoTSense-%20IoT%20Sentinel.ipynb)


These files convert the files with pcap extension to single packet-based, CSV extension fingerprint files (IoT Sentinel, IoTSense, IoTDevID individual packet based feature sets) and creates the labeling.


The processed datasets are shared in the repository. However, raw versions of the datasets used in the study and their addresses are given below.

| Dataset | capture year | Number of Devices | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
|[ Aalto University ](https://research.aalto.fi/en/datasets/iot-devices-captures)| 2016|31|Benign|
|[ UNSW-Sydney IEEE TMC ](https://iotanalytics.unsw.edu.au/iottraces)| 2016|31|Benign|
|[ UNSW-Sydney ACM SOSR](https://iotanalytics.unsw.edu.au/attack-data)| 2018|28|Benign & Malicious|




Since the UNSW data are very large, we filter the data on a device and session basis. You can access the Pcap files obtained from this filtering process from [ this link (Used Pcap Files)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RSnQJNTHj8FoS1KvBxbCGaS4sYmX3sPF/view).


In addition, the CSVs.zip file contains the feature sets that are the output of this step and that we used in our experiments. These files:
* Aalto_test_IoTDevID.csv
* Aalto_train_IoTDevID.csv
* Aalto_IoTSense_Test.csv
* Aalto_IoTSense_Train.csv
* Aalto_IoTSentinel_Test.csv

It lists the feature scores and the votes they have received and shows them on a plot. The six feature importance score calculation methods used are as follows.

    * Information Value using Weight of evidence.
    * Variable Importance using Random Forest.
    * Recursive Feature Elimination.
    * Variable Importance using Extra trees classifier.
    * Chi-Square best variables.
    *  L1-based feature selection.

    * k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN)
    * Random Forest (RF)
    * Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This file trains machine learning models using the individual packets of Aalto University dataset using the methods mentioned above and the optimised hyperparameters.



## 04 Performance Evaluation
#### Section V  in the article
There are four files relevant to this section. In our experiments above, we found that DT offers the best balance between predictive performance and inference time among other machine learning methods. Therefore, only DT is used in all our subsequent experiments.
