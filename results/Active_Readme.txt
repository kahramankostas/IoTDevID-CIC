Active Experiments
__________________________________________________

In this experiment, the whole IoT network (including all 40 devices) was captured in the Active State.
The Active State is defined as the period in the day during which devices produce network traffic from interactions,
as people sporadically enter the lab and interact with the devices, either actively or passively.
This experiment was conducted and captured for 30 days, so there are 30 .pcap files in total.
