abstract = {The ever-increasing amount of data in cellular networks poses challenges for network operators to monitor the quality of experience (QoE). Traditional key quality indicators (KQIs)-based hard decision methods are difficult to undertake the task of QoE anomaly detection in the case of big data. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a KQIs-based QoE anomaly detection framework using semi-supervised machine learning algorithm, i.e., iterative positive sample aided one-class support vector machine (IPS-OCSVM). There are four steps for realizing the proposed method while the key step is combining machine learning with the network operator's expert knowledge using OCSVM. Our proposed IPS-OCSVM framework realizes QoE anomaly detection through soft decision and can easily fine-Tune the anomaly detection ability on demand. Moreover, we prove that the fluctuation of KQIs thresholds based on expert knowledge has a limited impact on the result of anomaly detection. Finally, experiment results are given to confirm the proposed IPS-OCSVM framework for QoE anomaly detection in cellular networks.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection has gained considerable attention in the past couple of years. Emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), are known to be among the most critical sources of data streams that produce massive amounts of data continuously from numerous applications. Examining these collected data to detect suspicious events can reduce functional threats and avoid unseen issues that cause downtime in the applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the data stream characteristics, many unresolved problems persist. In the existing literature, methods have been designed and developed to evaluate certain anomalous behaviors in IoT data stream sources. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that discuss all the aspects of IoT data processing. Thus, this paper attempts to fill this gap by providing a complete image of various state-of-the-art techniques on the major problems and core challenges in IoT data. The nature of data, anomaly types, learning mode, window model, datasets, and evaluation criteria are also presented. Research challenges related to data evolving, feature-evolving, windowing, ensemble approaches, nature of input data, data complexity and noise, parameters selection, data visualizations, heterogeneity of data, accuracy, and large-scale and high-dimensional data are investigated. Finally, the challenges that require substantial research efforts and future directions are summarized.},

abstract = {Intrusion detection technology has received increasing attention in recent years. Many researchers have proposed various intrusion detection systems using machine learning (ML) methods. However, there are two noteworthy factors affecting the robustness of the model. One is the severe imbalance of network traffic in different categories and the other is the nonidentical distribution between training set and test set in feature space. This paper presents a multilevel intrusion detection model framework named multilevel semi-supervised ML (MSML) to address these issues. The MSML framework includes four modules: 1) pure cluster extraction; 2) pattern discovery; 3) fine-grained classification (FC); and 4) model updating. In the pure cluster module, we introduce an concept of 'pure cluster' and propose a hierarchical semi-supervised k-means algorithm with an aim to find out all the pure clusters. In the pattern discovery module, we define the 'unknown pattern' and apply cluster-based method aiming to find those unknown patterns. Then a test sample is sentenced to labeled known pattern or unlabeled unknown pattern. The FC module can achieves FC for those unknown pattern samples. The model updating module provides a mechanism for retraining. KDDCUP99 dataset is applied to evaluate MSML. Experimental results show that MSML is superior to other existing intrusion detection models in terms of overall accuracy, F1-score, and unknown pattern recognition capability.},

abstract = {An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an important protection instrument for detecting complex network attacks. Various machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed for implementing anomaly-based IDS (AIDS). Our review of the AIDS literature identifies some issues in related work, including the randomness of the selected algorithms, parameters, and testing criteria, the application of old datasets, or shallow analyses and validation of the results. This paper comprehensively reviews previous studies on AIDS by using a set of criteria with different datasets and types of attacks to set benchmarking outcomes that can reveal the suitable AIDS algorithms, parameters, and testing criteria. Specifically, this paper applies 10 popular supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms for identifying effective and efficient ML-AIDS of networks and computers. These supervised ML algorithms include the artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms, whereas the unsupervised ML algorithms include the expectation-maximization (EM), k-means, and self-organizing maps (SOM) algorithms. Several models of these algorithms are introduced, and the turning and training parameters of each algorithm are examined to achieve an optimal classifier evaluation. Unlike previous studies, this study evaluates the performance of AIDS by measuring the true positive and negative rates, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-Score of 31 ML-AIDS models. The training and testing time for ML-AIDS models are also considered in measuring their performance efficiency given that time complexity is an important factor in AIDSs. The ML-AIDS models are tested by using a recent and highly unbalanced multiclass CICIDS2017 dataset that involves real-world network attacks. In general, the k-NN-AIDS, DT-AIDS, and NB-AIDS models obtain the best results and show a greater capability in detecting web attacks compared with other models that demonstrate irregular and inferior results.},

abstract = {Even though advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been adopted for DDoS detection, the attack remains a major threat of the Internet. Most of the existing ML-based DDoS detection approaches are under two categories: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised ML approaches for DDoS detection rely on availability of labeled network traffic datasets. Whereas, unsupervised ML approaches detect attacks by analyzing the incoming network traffic. Both approaches are challenged by large amount of network traffic data, low detection accuracy and high false positive rates. In this paper we present an online sequential semi-supervised ML approach for DDoS detection based on network Entropy estimation, Co-clustering, Information Gain Ratio and Exra-Trees algorithm. The unsupervised part of the approach allows to reduce the irrelevant normal traffic data for DDoS detection which allows to reduce false positive rates and increase accuracy. Whereas, the supervised part allows to reduce the false positive rates of the unsupervised part and to accurately classify the DDoS traffic. Various experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed approach using three public datasets namely NSL-KDD, UNB ISCX 12 and UNSW-NB15. An accuracy of 98.23{\%}, 99.88{\%} and 93.71{\%} is achieved for respectively NSL-KDD, UNB ISCX 12 and UNSW-NB15 datasets, with respectively the false positive rates 0.33{\%}, 0.35{\%} and 0.46{\%}.},

An intrusion detection system (IDS) which is an important cyber security technique, monitors the state of software and hardware running in the network. Despite decades of development, existing IDSs still face challenges in improving the detection accuracy, reducing the false alarm rate and detecting unknown attacks. To solve the above problems, many researchers have focused on developing IDSs that capitalize on machine learning methods. Machine learning methods can automatically discover the essential differences between normal data and abnormal data with high accuracy. In addition, machine learning methods have strong generalizability, so they are also able to detect unknown attacks. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning, whose performance is remarkable and has become a research hotspot. This survey proposes a taxonomy of IDS that takes data objects as the main dimension to classify and summarize machine learning-based and deep learning-based IDS literature.We believe that this type of taxonomy framework is fit for cyber security researchers. The survey first clarifies the concept and taxonomy of IDSs. Then, the machine learning algorithms frequently used in IDSs, metrics, and benchmark datasets are introduced. Next, combined with the representative literature, we take the proposed taxonomic system as a baseline and explain how to solve key IDS issues with machine learning and deep learning techniques. Finally, challenges and future developments are discussed by reviewing recent representative studies.},

As massive number of IoT devices are deployed, they naturally incurs great operational costs to ensure intended operations. To effectively handle such intended operations in massive IoT networks, automatic detection of malfunctioning, namely anomaly detection, becomes a critical but challenging task. In this paper, motivated by a real-world experimental IoT deployment, we introduce four types of wireless network anomalies that are identified at the link layer. We study the performance of threshold-and machine learning (ML)-based classifiers to automatically detect these anomalies. We examine the relative performance of three supervised and three unsupervised ML techniques on both non-encoded and encoded (autoencoder) feature representations. Our results demonstrate that; i) selected supervised approaches are able to detect anomalies with F1 scores of above 0.98, while unsupervised ones are also capable of detecting the said anomalies with F1 scores of, on average, 0.90, and ii) OC-SVM outperforms all the other unsupervised ML approaches reaching at F1 scores of 0.99 for SuddenD, 0.95 for SuddenR, 0.93 for InstaD and 0.95 for SlowD.},

Performance assessment of classifiers is done in terms of prominent metrics and validation methods. Popular datasets CIDDS-001, UNSW-NB15, and NSL-KDD are used for benchmarking classifiers. Friedman and Nemenyi tests are employed to analyze the significant differences among classifiers statistically. In addition, Raspberry Pi is used to evaluate the response time of classifiers on IoT specific hardware.

One aspect of data analytics is anomaly detection within data points received in some cases in real time that help to conduct predictive maintenance, weather monitoring or cyber security forensics for instance. Although there exists a number of web dashboards that allow IoT users to visualize data in time domain and perform statistical analysis, anomaly detection is often absent else if present not that straightforward, reliable and accurate. The development and implementation of Anomaly Detection Engine (ADE) poses a number of challenges that are in fact addressed in this paper. The research work exposes the multifaceted aspect of IoT networks and applications based on real life use cases and the difficulties engendered in mounting an ADE from both software system engineering and network convergence perspectives. Moreover a comparative description of diverse time series models adopted in anomaly detection is undertaken. It was noticed that there is neither one size fit all solution nor a plug n play alternative and that the unsupervised mode in machine learning as a model for time series analysis is the most versatile and efficient technique for IoT analytics developers.},

abstract = {With the increased use of Internet resources, cyber attackers are using novel ways to attack the services of network. Thus network security is becoming inevitable part of the network system. In order to detect such attacks efficiently and effectively, robust IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is needed. An IDS is a tool that analyzes each and every packet deeply to detects malicious activity by monitoring a network or a system. The main purpose of IDS is to identify unwanted or abnormal action and to inform the network administrator about such actions. Thus, IDS is important tool for the network administrator to prevent the network from both known and unknown attacks that make the network resources more vulnerable. Machine learning methods can be used to employ efficient intrusion detection system (IDS). In this research work four machine learning methods were used namely RF (Random Forest), DT (Decision Tree), MLP (Multilayer perceptron) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) for classification of the data. NSL-KDD dataset was used for training and testing these various machine learning models. Feature selections were used to eliminate the irrelevant and unwanted features from the dataset. Therefore feature selection reduces the dimensionality of the dataset which in turn reduces the computational complexity. The proposed model's output was evaluated using three feature subsets, randomly selected from the NSL-KDD dataset. The proposed method has a classification accuracy of more than 99 percent.},

abstract = {Collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) are developing to improve the detection performance of a single detector in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, through exchanging and sharing data. For anomaly detection, machine learning is an important and essential tool to help identify the deviation between current events and pre-built profile. For a traditional supervised learning classifier, there is a need to provide training examples with ground-truth labels in advance. However, labeled instances are quite limited in real-world IoT scenarios, while unlabeled data/instances are widely available. This is because data labeling is a very expensive process that requires huge human efforts and knowledge inputs. To mitigate this issue, the use of semi-supervised learning algorithms is a promising solution, which can leverage unlabeled data to label data automatically without human intervention. In this work, we focus on semi-supervised learning and design DAS-CIDS, by applying disagreement-based semi-supervised learning algorithm for CIDSs. In the evaluation, we investigate the performance of DAS-CIDS using both datasets and in real IoT network environments, in the aspects of both detection performance and false alarm reduction. The experimental results show that as compared with traditional supervised classifiers, our approach is more effective in detecting intrusions and reducing false alarms by automatically leveraging unlabeled data.},

The adoption of the IoT has brought about tremendous innovation opportunities in industries, homes, the environment, and businesses. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of the IoT have sparked concerns for wide adoption and applications. Unlike traditional information technology (I.T.) systems, the IoT environment is challenging to secure due to resource constraints, heterogeneity, and distributed nature of the smart devices. This makes it impossible to apply host-based prevention mechanisms such as anti-malware and anti-virus. These challenges and the nature of IoT applications call for a monitoring system such as anomaly detection both at device and network levels beyond the organisational boundary. This suggests an anomaly detection system is strongly positioned to secure IoT devices better than any other security mechanism. In this paper, we aim to provide an in-depth review of existing works in developing anomaly detection solutions using machine learning for protecting an IoT system. We also indicate that blockchain-based anomaly detection systems can collaboratively learn effective machine learning models to detect anomalies.},

@article{Rathore2018,
abstract = {Alongside the development of Internet of Things (IoT), security attacks are also increasing day by day. A number of centralized attack detection mechanisms have been proposed to detect attacks in IoT, wherein an attack detection system is deployed at the central point in the network that collects data from the network and classifies it as “attack” or “normal” using a supervised machine learning algorithm. Note, however, that these mechanisms have failed to achieve significant results due to the distinct requirements of IoT devices, such as scalability, distribution, resource limitations, and low latency. Moreover, the application of supervised machine learning for classification needs a significant amount of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce a fog-based attack detection framework that relies on the fog computing paradigm and a newly proposed ELM-based Semi-supervised Fuzzy C-Means (ESFCM) method. As an extension of cloud computing, fog computing enables attack detection at the network edge and supports distributed attack detection. The ESFCM method uses a semi-supervised fuzzy c-means algorithm to handle the labeled data issue and an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm to provide good generalization performance at a faster detection rate. The evaluation was performed on the NSL-KDD dataset, demonstrating that the proposed framework achieved better performance than the centralized attack detection framework. More specifically, it recorded a lower detection time of 11 milliseconds and an accuracy rate of 86.53{\%}.},

The first part details the process and results of establishing reference classification scores on CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, two modern, labeled data sets for testing intrusion detection systems. The data sets are divided into several days each pertaining to different attack classes (DoS, DDoS, infiltration, botnet, etc.). A pipeline has been created that includes twelve supervised learning algorithms from different families. Subsequently to this comparative analysis the DoS / SSL and botnet attack classes, which are represented in both data sets and are well-classified by many algorithms, have been selected to test the inter-dataset generalization strength of the trained models. Exposure of these models to unseen, but related samples without additional training was expected to maintain high classification performance, but this assumption is shown to be erroneous (at least for the tested attack classes). To our knowledge, there is no prior literature that validates the efficacy of supervised ML-based intrusion detection systems outside of the dataset(s) on which they have been trained. Our first results question the implied link that great intra-dataset generalization leads to great inter- or extra-dataset generalization. Further experimentation is required to discover the scope and causes of this deficiency as well as potential solutions.},

With this proposed semi-supervised learning approach, I detect botnet traffic and distinguish it from the normal and background network traffic in the network session or flow datasets (i.e., NetFlow files). I evaluate the prediction performance and computational resource utilization results for the flow-based NIDS algorithms and compare these results with signature-based NIDS that are reactive by design. With this approach, I show an improvement in detection accuracy and NIDS efficiency when compared with traditional signature-based NIDS and other probabilistic modeling approaches examined on these network traffic datasets.

abstract = {Intrusion detection system (IDS) plays an essential role in computer networks protecting computing resources and data from outside attacks. Recent IDS faces challenges improving flexibility and efficiency of the IDS for unexpected and unpredictable attacks. Deep neural network (DNN) is considered popularly for complex systems to abstract features and learn as a machine learning technique. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for developing the efficient and flexible IDS using one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN). Two-dimensional CNN methods have shown remarkable performance in detecting objects of images in computer vision area. Meanwhile, the 1D-CNN can be used for supervised learning on time-series data. We establish a machine learning model based on the 1D-CNN by serializing Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) packets in a predetermined time range as an invasion Internet traffic model for the IDS, where normal and abnormal network traffics are categorized and labeled for supervised learning in the 1D-CNN. We evaluated our model on UNSWNB15 IDS dataset to show the effectiveness of our method. For comparison study in performance, machine learning-based Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models in addition to the 1D-CNN with various network parameters and architecture are exploited. In each experiment, the models are run up to 200 epochs with a learning rate in 0.0001 on imbalanced and balanced data. 1D-CNN and its variant architectures have outperformed compared to the classical machine learning classifiers. This is mainly due to the reason that CNN has the capability to extract high-level feature representations that represent the abstract form of low-level feature sets of network traffic connections.},

abstract = {With the advance in technology, now a day's cyber-attack is more sophisticated which is not easily detected by the any intrusion detection system (IDS). Since most of the user store their private and sensitive information into the computer or any other digital media so providing security to these computers from the attacker is the essential requirement of each user. As number of intrusion detection system have been proposed in the last few decades. These IDS are mainly classified in two different types named signature based intrusion detection system and anomaly based intrusion detection system. The main objective of this paper is to compare various existing IDS with their strength and weakness. This paper will also discuss various machine learning approach and data sets which are used to detect intrusion. This paper will also discuss various challenges which makes IDS design more challenging.},

abstract = {IoT is characterized by communication between things (devices) that constantly share data, analyze, and make decisions while connected to the internet. This interconnected architecture is attracting cyber criminals to expose the IoT system to failure. Therefore, it becomes imperative to develop a system that can accurately and automatically detect anomalies and attacks occurring in IoT networks. Therefore, in this paper, an Intrsuion Detection System (IDS) based on extracted novel feature set synthesizing BoT-IoT dataset is developed that can swiftly, accurately and automatically differentiate benign and malicious traffic. Instead of using available feature reduction techniques like PCA that can change the core meaning of variables, a unique feature set consisting of only seven lightweight features is developed that is also IoT specific and attack traffic independent. Also, the results shown in the study demonstrates the effectiveness of fabricated seven features in detecting four wide variety of attacks namely DDoS, DoS, Reconnaissance, and Information Theft. Furthermore, this study also proves the applicability and efficiency of supervised machine learning algorithms (KNN, LR, SVM, MLP, DT, RF) in IoT security. The performance of the proposed system is validated using performance Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F-Score and ROC. Though the accuracy of Decision Tree (99.9{\%}) and Randon Forest (99.9{\%}) Classifiers are same but other metrics like training and testing time shows Random Forest comparatively better.},

IoT has many applications in building smart cities, smart environment, e-health care, etc. Due to the presence of unreliable internet and new routing protocols for low-power devices, IoT requires innovative security solutions. In this paper, we present three new Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for IoT: 1) K-means clustering unsupervised learning based IDS; 2) decision tree based supervised IDS; and 3) a hybrid two stage IDS that combines K-means and decision tree learning approaches. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first machine learning based IDSs (together called as ML-IDS) for IoT. All the three IDS are centralized and scalable approaches. The K-means approach achieves 70-93{\%} detection rate for varying sizes of random IoT networks. Decision tree based IDS achieves 71-80{\%} detection rate and the hybrid approach attains 71-75{\%} detection rate for the same network sizes. Although the hybrid IDS obtains lower detection rate, it is more accurate than the other two approaches. The hybrid approach eliminates the false positives significantly, while the other two IDS suffer from a higher number of false positives. Similar results are also obtained for regular mesh, star and ring topologies of IoT networks, each comprising 16 nodes.},

The heterogeneous nature of IoT systems prevents common benchmarks, such as the NSL-KDD dataset, from being used to test and verify the performance of different Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). In order to bridge this gap, in this paper, we examine specific attacks in the NSL-KDD dataset that can impact sensor nodes and networks in IoT settings. Furthermore, in order to detect the introduced attacks, we study eleven machine learning algorithms and report the results. Through numerical analysis, we show that tree-based methods and ensemble methods outperform the rest of the studied machine learning methods. Among the supervised algorithms, XGBoost ranks the first with 97{\%} accuracy, 90.5{\%} Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and 99.6{\%} Area Under the Curve (AUC) performance. Moreover, a notable research finding of this study is that the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which is an unsupervised method, also performs reasonably well in the detection of the attacks in the NSL-KDD dataset and outperforms the accuracy of the Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifier by 22.0{\%}.},

abstract = {Software-defined Networking (SDN) has recently developed and been put forward as a promising and encouraging solution for future internet architecture. Managed, the centralized and controlled network has become more flexible and visible using SDN. On the other hand, these advantages bring us a more vulnerable environment and dangerous threats, causing network breakdowns, systems paralysis, online banking frauds and robberies. These issues have a significantly destructive impact on organizations, companies or even economies. Accuracy, high performance and real-time systems are essential to achieve this goal successfully. Extending intelligent machine learning algorithms in a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) through a software-defined network (SDN) has attracted considerable attention in the last decade. Big data availability, the diversity of data analysis techniques, and the massive improvement in the machine learning algorithms enable the building of an effective, reliable and dependable system for detecting different types of attacks that frequently target networks. This study demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms for traffic monitoring to detect malicious behavior in the network as part of NIDS in the SDN controller. Different classical and advanced tree-based machine learning techniques, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost are chosen to demonstrate attack detection. The NSL-KDD dataset is used for training and testing the proposed methods; it is considered a benchmarking dataset for several state-of-the-art approaches in NIDS. Several advanced preprocessing techniques are performed on the dataset in order to extract the best form of the data, which produces outstanding results compared to other systems. Using just five out of 41 features of NSL-KDD, a multi-class classification task is conducted by detecting whether there is an attack and classifying the type of attack (DDoS, PROBE, R2L, and U2R), accomplishing an accuracy of 95.95{\%}.},

abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming increasingly popular, we have experienced more security breaches that are associated with the connection of vulnerable IoT devices. Therefore, it is crucial to employ intrusion detection techniques to mitigate attacks that exploit IoT security vulnerabilities. However, due to the limited capabilities of IoT devices and the specific protocols used, conventional intrusion detection mechanisms may not work well for IoT environments. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection model that uses machine learning to effectively detect cyber-attacks and anomalies in resource-constraint IoT networks. Through a set of optimizations including removal of multicollinearity, sampling, and dimensionality reduction, our model can identify the most important features to detect intrusions using much fewer training data and less training time. Extensive experiments were performed on the CICIDS2017 and NSL-KDD datasets respectively to evaluate the proposed approach. The experimental results on two popular datasets show that our model has a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. It outperforms existing models in multiple performance metrics and is consistent in classifying major cyber-attacks, respectively. Most importantly, unlike traditional resource-intensive intrusion detection systems, the proposed model is lightweight and can be deployed on IoT nodes with limited power and storage capabilities.},

abstract = {In computer networks, Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm wherein smart and resource-constrained objects can connect to Internet by using a wide range of technologies. Due to the insecure nature of Internet and also wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which are the main components of IoT, implementing security mechanisms in IoT seems necessary. To deal with intrusions which may occur in IoT, a novel intrusion detection architecture model for IoT is proposed in this paper. This model is based on MapReduce approach with the aim of distributed detection. To provide multi-faceted detection (from the Internet and WSNs sides), the proposed model consists of anomaly-based and misuse-based intrusion detection agents that use supervised and unsupervised optimum-path forest model for intrusion detection. The experimental results of simulated scenarios show the superior performance of proposed method in intrusion detection for IoT.},

abstract = {The modeling of an efficient classifier is a fundamental issue in automatic training involving a large volume of representative data. Hence, automatic classification is a major task that entails the use of training methods capable of assigning classes to data objects by using the input activities presented to learn classes. The recognition of new elements is possible based on predefined classes. Intrusion detection systems suffer from numerous vulnerabilities during analysis and classification of data activities. To overcome this problem, new analysis methods should be derived so as to implement a relevant system to monitor circulated traffic. The main objective of this study is to model and validate a heterogeneous traffic classifier capable of categorizing collected events within networks. The new model is based on a proposed machine learning algorithm that comprises an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. A reliable training algorithm is proposed to optimize the weights, and a recognition algorithm is used to validate the model. Preprocessing is applied to the collected traffic prior to the analysis step. This work aims to describe the mathematical validation of a new machine learning classifier for heterogeneous traffic and anomaly detection.},

abstract = {This paper describes the process and results of analyzing CICIDS2017, a modern, labeled data set for testing intrusion detection systems. The data set is divided into several days, each pertaining to different attack classes (Dos, DDoS, infiltration, botnet, etc.). A pipeline has been created that includes nine supervised learning algorithms. The goal was binary classification of benign versus attack traffic. Cross-validated parameter optimization, using a voting mechanism that includes five classification metrics, was employed to select optimal parameters. These results were interpreted to discover whether certain parameter choices were dominant for most (or all) of the attack classes. Ultimately, every algorithm was retested with optimal parameters to obtain the final classification scores. During the review of these results, execution time, both on consumer- and corporate-grade equipment, was taken into account as an additional requirement. The work detailed in this paper establishes a novel supervised machine learning performance baseline for CICIDS2017.

Authentication becomes critical in a highly secured environment and reliable communication, specifically trustworthiness. In security, nonrepudiation refers to a service, which provides proof of the origin of data and the integrity of the data. Hence, this factor is to be considered in an IoT environment. This work focuses on the proposed Trust Aggregation Authentication Protocol based on the Machine Learning technique (TAAPML). The total trust value is derived for each device from behavior and data trust values by the internet gateways. In the authentication phase, if either the trust value is less than a standard threshold value or the authentication token is invalid, then gateways omit that node. The trust threshold value is adaptively calculated by using a technique called Support Vector Machine (SVM) over the collected traffic data. TAAPML technique performance is evaluated with respect to Packet Delivery Ratio, Delay, Residual Energy, and Computational Overhead.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has generated a huge amount of traffic that can be exploited for detecting intrusions through IoT networks. Despite the great effort made in annotating IoT traffic records, the number of labeled records is still very small, increasing the difficulty in recognizing attacks and intrusions. This study introduces a semi-supervised deep learning approach for intrusion detection (SS-Deep-ID), in which we propose a multiscale residual temporal convolutional (MS-Res) module to finetune the network capability in learning spatiotemporal representations. An improved traffic attention (TA) mechanism is introduced to estimate the importance score that helps the model to concentrate on important information during learning. Furthermore, a hierarchical semi-supervised training method is introduced which takes into account the sequential characteristics of the IoT traffic data during training. The proposed SS-Deep-ID is easily integrated into a fog-enabled IoT network to offer efficient real-time intrusion detection. Finally, empirical evaluations on two recent data sets (CIC-IDS2017 and CIC-IDS2018) demonstrate that SS-Deep-ID improves the efficiency of intrusion detection and increases the robustness of performance while maintaining computational efficiency.},

In this work, a deep learning approach for anomaly detection using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and a deep belief network are implemented. Our method uses a one-hidden layer RBM to perform unsupervised feature reduction. The resultant weights from this RBM are passed to another RBM producing a deep belief network. The pre-trained weights are passed into a fine tuning layer consisting of a Logistic Regression (LR) classifier with multi-class soft-max. We have implemented the deep learning architecture in C++ in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 and we use the DARPA KDD-CUP'99 dataset to evaluate its performance. Our architecture outperforms previous deep learning methods implemented by Li and Salama in both detection speed and accuracy. We achieve a detection rate of 97.9{\%} on the total 10{\%} KDDCUP'99 test dataset. By improving the training process of the simulation, we are also able to produce a low false negative rate of 2.47{\%}. Although the deficiencies in the KDDCUP'99 dataset are well understood, it still presents machine learning approaches for predicting attacks with a reasonable challenge.

abstract = {A Machine Learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) requires a large amount of labeled up-to-date training data to effectively detect intrusions and generalize well to novel attacks. However, the labeling of data is costly and becomes infeasible when dealing with big data, such as those generated by Internet of Things applications. To this effect, building an ML model that learns from non-labeled or partially labeled data is of critical importance. This paper proposes a Semi-supervised Multi-Layered Clustering ((SMLC)) model for the detection and prevention of network intrusion. SMLC has the capability to learn from partially labeled data while achieving a detection performance comparable to that of supervised ML-based IDPS. The performance of SMLC is compared with that of a well-known semi-supervised model (tri-training) and of supervised ensemble ML models, namely RandomForest, Bagging, and AdaboostM1 on two benchmark network-intrusion datasets, NSL and Kyoto 2006+. Experimental results show that SMLC is superior to tri-training, providing a comparable detection accuracy with 20{\%} less labeled instances of training data. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that our scheme has a detection accuracy comparable to that of the supervised ensemble models.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a complex paradigm where billions of devices are connected to a network. These connected devices form an intelligent system of systems that share the data without human-to-computer or human-to-human interaction. These systems extract meaningful data that can transform human lives, businesses, and the world in significant ways. However, the reality of IoT is prone to countless cyber-attacks in the extremely hostile environment like the internet. The recent hack of 2014 Jeep Cherokee, iStan pacemaker, and a German steel plant are a few notable security breaches. To secure an IoT system, the traditional high-end security solutions are not suitable, as IoT devices are of low storage capacity and less processing power. Moreover, the IoT devices are connected for longer time periods without human intervention. This raises a need to develop smart security solutions which are light-weight, distributed and have a high longevity of service. Rather than per-device security for numerous IoT devices, it is more feasible to implement security solutions for network data. The artificial intelligence theories like Machine Learning and Deep Learning have already proven their significance when dealing with heterogeneous data of various sizes. To substantiate this, in this research, we have applied concepts of Deep Learning and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to build a light-weight distributed security solution with high durability for IoT network security. First, we have examined the ways of improving IoT architecture and proposed a lightweight and multi-layered design for an IoT network. Second, we have analyzed the existing iv applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning to the IoT and Cyber-Security. Third, we have evaluated deep learning's Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM and GRU) on the DARPA/KDD Cup '99 intrusion detection data set for each layer in the designed architecture. Finally, from the evaluated metrics, we have proposed the best neural network design suitable for the IoT Intrusion Detection System. With an accuracy of 98.91{\%} and False Alarm Rate of 0.76 {\%}, this unique research outperformed the performance results of existing methods over the KDD Cup '99 dataset. For this first time in the IoT research, the concepts of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks are applied for the IoT security.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of distributed devices or sensors connected through the internet to allow gathering and sharing of data. The data generated by these devices is affected by anomalies or abnormal behaviour due to attack issues, or breakdown in devices, as examples. However, most current anomaly detection systems rely on labelled data, while the class labels for IoT data are usually unavailable. Furthermore, the manual labelling task is expensive and time-consuming to perform due to the need for domain experts. More importantly, the volume of data in the IoT is growing rapidly, creating a need to predict the classification labels for future data. This study proposes a Hybrid Learning Model which uses both Clustering and Classification methods (HLMCC) to automate the labelling process and detect anomalies in IoT data. The model consists of two practical phases, automatic labelling and detecting anomalies. First, the HLMCC groups the data into normal and anomaly clusters by adopting Hierarchical Affinity Propagation (HAP) clustering. Second, the labelled data obtained from the clustering phase is used to train the Decision Trees (DTs) and to classify future unseen data. The results show that the HLMCC is able to automate the labelling of data, which is beneficial to minimize human involvement.

abstract = {In the era of modern lifestyle, the internet and networking are essential things for everyone. With the help these facilities everyone can exchange information between intranet and internet-connected people. During the information exchange, so many intermediate devices are involved, so that the security of information or data is primary concern for each and every involved system. Attackers or intruders belong to inside the network or outside of the network. To detect an intruder or attacker an intrusion detection system (IDS) has been proposed for the detection of normal and attack data packets for a network. In this work, KDD-99 dataset is used for the development of IDS. A total set of 32,640 samples are considered, in which 12,440 samples of normal and 20,200 samples of attack class are used. These samples are further bifurcated into training and testing set in balanced manner. Thus, 16,320 samples (normal: 6220 and attack: 10,100) are used for training set and same number of set is used for the testing set. For the supervised learning, SVM and kNN classifiers are used to differentiate between normal data packets and attack data packets with PCA as dimensionality reduction. After the successful completion of experiments, it has been found that PCA-kNN yields maximum accuracy of 90.07{\%} at pc value of 5 using cosine distance.},

The significance of IoT in the daily life is increasing due to the increase in objects or things connected to the internet. In this paper, routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) is examined on the Contiki operating system. This paper used RPL attack framework to simulate three RPL attacks, namely hello-flood, decreased-rank and increased-version. These attacks are simulated in a separate and simultaneous manner. The focus remained on the detection of these attacks through artificial neural network (ANN)-based supervised machine learning approach. The accurate detection of the malicious nodes prevents the network from the severe effects of the attack. The accuracy of the proposed model is computed with hold-out approach and tenfold cross-validation technique. The hyperparameters have been optimized through parameter tuning. The model presented in this paper detected the aforesaid attacks simultaneously as well as individually with 100{\%} accuracy. This work also investigated other performance measures like precision, recall, F1-score and Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC).},

In this paper, we are addressing several positive measures regarding the use of machine learning (ML) modalities like supervised learning (SL), unsupervised learning (UL), semi- supervised learning (SSL), reinforcement learning (RL), support vector machines (SVM) which are used for training IoT devices. This paper also addresses a brief survey of the scenarios where machine learning algorithms have been applied in various IoT devices and networks such as signal authentication, security, network flow, information retrieval, traffic management, spectrum sensing. It also indicates the necessity of surveying the scattered works on machine and deep learning applications for various aspects like security, congestion control over wireless computer networks, embedded sensor systems for IoT applications. Several limitations of existing researches and a number of open research issues which fellow researchers may find useful in the future have also been discussed.},

Afterwards, different mechanisms using statistics, wavelet transform, and deep learning autoencoder concepts are applied to different classes of time series for detecting anomalies.

abstract = {Intrusion detection systems plays a pivotal role in detecting malicious activities that denigrate the performance of the network. Mobile adhoc networks (MANETs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a form of wireless network that can transfer data without any need of infrastructure for their operation. A more novel paradigm of networking, namely Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged recently which can be considered as a superset to the afore mentioned paradigms. Their distributed nature and the limited resources available, present a considerable challenge for providing security to these networks. The need for an intrusion detection system (IDS) that can acclimate with such challenges is of extreme significance. Previously, we proposed a cross layer-based IDS with two layers of detection. It uses a heuristic approach which is based on the variability of the correctly classified instances (CCIs), which we refer to as the accumulated measure of fluctuation (AMoF). The current, proposed IDS is composed of two stages; stage one collects data through dedicated sniffers (DSs) and generates the CCI which is sent in a periodic fashion to the super node (SN), and in stage two the SN performs the linear regression process for the collected CCIs from different DSs in order to differentiate the benign from the malicious nodes. In this work, the detection characterization is presented for different extreme scenarios in the network, pertaining to the power level and node velocity for two different mobility models: Random way point (RWP), and Gauss Markov (GM). Malicious activity used in the work are the blackhole and the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Detection rates are in excess of 98{\%} for high power/node velocity scenarios while they drop to around 90{\%} for low power/node velocity scenarios.},

abstract = {In this paper, the k-means algorithm is applied to IEEE C37.118.2 synchrophasor network traffic data to model the expected packet features under normal operating conditions. Once the model is trained, anomalies in the data are introduced using packet manipulation and packet injection. Anomalies in this research are defined as any packets in the network traffic from an unknown IP address, irregularities in the byte length of the synchrophasor data, or any packet with a network latency longer than is characteristic of the network. The trained model detects these simulated anomalies by assigning each test packet to a trained cluster centroid and determining if the distortion of the test packet qualifies it as an anomaly. This paper describes the problems and opportunities that arise from smart grid technologies, why using machine learning for anomaly detection is essential in control system environments, and how the model is developed to detect anomalies.},

This work explores the use of machine learning methods for anomaly detection in network traffic of an IoT network that is connected through a Software Defined Network (SDN). The use of SDN allows a hierarchical approach to machine learning with the aim of reducing the packet level processing of anomaly detection at the edge through applying additional, centralized, machine learning in the SDN controller. For the sake of evaluation, we compare several supervised classification algorithms using a publicly available dataset. The results support a decision-tree based approach and show that the proposed solution promises a considerable reduction in the per-packet processing at the network edge compared to a single stage classifier.},

Hence, the power consumption anomaly was able to be detected by machine learning algorithms. In this paper, a three-stage multi-view stacking ensemble (TMSE) machine learning model based on hierarchical time series feature extraction (HTSF) methods are proposed to solve the anomaly detection problem: HTSF is a novel systematic time series feature engineering method to represent the given data numerically and as input data for machine learning algorithms, while TMSE is designed to ensemble meta-models to archive more accurate performance by using multi-view stacking ensemble method. Performance evaluation in real-world data shows that the proposed method outperforms the existing time series feature extraction means and dramatically decreases the time consumed for ensemble learning process.},

SDS can be applied to an intrusion detection system to create a more proactive and end-to-end defence for a 5G network.

The results from this method are promising as the model has identified benign traffic with a 100{\%} accuracy rate and anomalous traffic with a 96.4{\%} detection rate. This demonstrates the effectiveness of network flow analysis for a variety of common malicious attacks and also provides a viable option for detection of encrypted malicious network traffic.},

While past research has been focused on centralized intrusion detection assuming the existence of a central entity to store and perform analysis on data from all participant devices, these approaches cannot scale well with the fast growth of ioT connected devices and introduce a single-point failure risk that may compromise data privacy. Moreover, with data being widely spread across large networks of connected devices, decentralized computations are very much in need. in this context, we propose in this article a Federated Learning based scheme for ioT intrusion detection that maintains data privacy by performing local training and inference of detection models. in this scheme, not only privacy can be assured, but also devices can benefit from their peers' knowledge by communicating only their updates with a remote server that aggregates the latter and shares an improved detection model with participating devices. We perform thorough experiments on an NSL-KDD dataset to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach. Experimental results and empirical analysis explore the robustness and advantages of the proposed Federated Learning detection model by reaching an accuracy close to that of the centralized approach and outperforming the distributed unaggregated on-device trained models.},

With its wide range of application domains, including smart cities, smart homes, and e-health, the IoT has created new challenges, particularly security threats. Traditional security solutions, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, need amending to fit the new networking paradigm. Given the recent advances in machine learning, we investigated the use of deep learning algorithms for anomaly detection. The IoT collects a massive amount of data from the environment, and deep learning is based on a set of algorithms striving for the data.

Anomaly detection is a conventional intrusion detection approach that separates normal and abnormal network traffic using statistical, rule-based, or machine learning models.

However, there are limitations in applying deep learning to network anomaly detection. This paper proposes a novel anomaly detection framework based on unsupervised deep learning algorithms for revealing network threats.

As the number of attacks possible on a network increases, it becomes more difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to cope with these attacks efficiently. In this paper, we highlight several machine learning (ML) methods such as k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and logistic regression (LR) that can be used in IDS. In this work, ML algorithms are compared for both binary and multi-class classification on Bot-IoT dataset. Based on several parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss, we experimentally compared the aforementioned ML algorithms. In the case of HTTP distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the accuracy of RF is 99{\%}. Furthermore, other simulation results-based precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss metric reveal that RF outperforms on all types of attacks in binary classification.

abstract = {As new cyberattacks are launched against systems and networks on a daily basis, the ability for network intrusion detection systems to operate efficiently in the big data era has become critically important, particularly as more low-power Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices enter the market. This has motivated research in applying machine learning algorithms that can operate on streams of data, trained online or "live" on only a small amount of data kept in memory at a time, as opposed to the more classical approaches that are trained solely offline on all of the data at once. In this context, one important concept from machine learning for improving detection performance is the idea of "ensembles", where a collection of machine learning algorithms are combined to compensate for their individual limitations and produce an overall superior algorithm. Unfortunately, existing research lacks proper performance comparison between homogeneous and heterogeneous online ensembles. Hence, this paper investigates several homogeneous and heterogeneous ensembles, proposes three novel online heterogeneous ensembles for intrusion detection, and compares their performance accuracy, run-time complexity, and response to concept drifts. Out of the proposed novel online ensembles, the heterogeneous ensemble consisting of an adaptive random forest of Hoeffding Trees combined with a Hoeffding Adaptive Tree performed the best, by dealing with concept drift in the most effective way. While this scheme is less accurate than a larger size adaptive random forest, it offered a marginally better run-time, which is beneficial for online training.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection/prediction is the first step to secure IoT systems. It usually relies on wide domain knowledge to build up the tools to automatically detect/predict abnormal events or behaviors of an IoT system. However, an IoT system may consist of machines with different capabilities, functionalities and ages. Furthermore, abnormal events or behaviors are usually rare events. It is time-consuming and high-cost to build up the domain knowhow of the IoT systems and collect enough data points of the anomaly. In this article, we first identify the issues and challenges. Then we illustrate a general environment for anomaly detection/prediction on the IoT systems. Then we survey the core technologies and existing solutions that may be applied for anomaly detection/prediction. We also identify what cannot be achieved by the existing solutions. Then considering four datasets, we show the performance comparison for different solutions by running experiments.},

This paper proposes a novel model for intrusion detection which is based on dimensionreduction algorithm and a classifier, which can be used as an online machine learning algorithm. The proposed model uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensions of dataset from a large number of features to a small number. To develop a classifier, softmax regression and k-nearestneighbour algorithms are applied and compared. Experimental results using KDD Cup 99 Data Set show that our proposed model performs optimally in labelling benign behaviours and identifying malicious behaviours.

However, the increase in IoT devices has brought with it the challenge of promptly detecting and combating the cybersecurity attacks and threats that target them, including malware, privacy breaches and denial of service attacks, among others. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes an intelligent architecture that integrates Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology and the Machine Learning (ML) paradigm in order to detect different types of IoT security attacks in real time. In particular, such an architecture is capable of easily managing event patterns whose conditions depend on values obtained by ML algorithms. Additionally, a model-driven graphical tool for security attack pattern definition and automatic code generation is provided, hiding all the complexity derived from implementation details from domain experts. The proposed architecture has been applied in the case of a healthcare IoT network to validate its ability to detect attacks made by malicious devices. The results obtained demonstrate that this architecture satisfactorily fulfils its objectives.},

In this chapter, we propose a hybrid model designed to detect abnormal intrusions such as Remote to Local (R2L) and User to Root (U2R). The proposed model leverages an unsupervised learning algorithm that applies back-propagation to learn the identity function of attacks data and also reduce the dimension of dataset and cluster the data. Furthermore, we apply the Generative Local Metric Learning (GLML) on cluster to learn local metrics within each cluster to apply a robust nearest neighbor classifier.

abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of things (IoT) devices has lured hackers to launch attacks. Therefore, anomalies in IoT traffic must be detected to mitigate these attacks and protect services rendered by smart devices. The lacuna in the existing anomaly detection techniques is the nonscalable nature of anomaly detection systems, resulting in the mishandling of large-scale data generated from IoT devices. The issue of scalability is addressed and an anomaly detection framework in a fog environment is proposed herein using vector convolutional deep learning (VCDL) approach. The anomaly detection system could be scalable if the traffic can be distributed to the nodes in the fog layer for processing. This is effectively captured in the VCDL approach in which the training of IoT traffic is distributed and computations are performed in the fog nodes. The parameters required for training are shared by the master node in the fog layer. Further, the proposed anomaly detection algorithm classifies IoT traffic as either normal or attack and then passes it to the cloud for attack mitigation. Experiments were conducted on UNSW's Bot-IoT dataset and the results indicate that the proposed distributed deep learning approach can efficiently handle scalable data compared with the existing centralized deep learning approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is significantly better in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall compared with the state-of-the-art anomaly detection systems.},

As time goes by more and more devices are being connected within any given network. All these devices will be vulnerable to attacks if any one of the devices is compromised within the network. This complicates Intrusion Detection in any given network. Manual detection and intervention is nearly impossible.

The physical system has created the Internet of Things IoT by integrating sensors, controllers and actuators. Nevertheless, the cyberspace of these aerospace CPSes offers many opportunities for malicious actors who threaten the security and privacy of vehicles/aircraft and their applications. Unprotected or poorly protected systems can easily be exploited for malicious purposes. Indeed, aerospace CPSes are always under threat from an increasing number of cyber-attacks through sensory or wireless channels, hardware, software or actuators. Recently, due to the significant advances and impressive results of machine learning techniques in the fields of image recognition, natural language processing and speech recognition for various long-standing artificial intelligence tasks, there has been a great interest in applying them to intrusion detection in the field of cybersecurity. In this chapter, we present different machine learning techniques for IoT intrusion detection in aerospace cyber-physical systems. The application of machine learning for cybersecurity in IoT requires the availability of substantial data on IoT attacks, but the lack of data on IoT attacks is a significant problem. In our study, the Cooja IoT simulator was used to generate high fidelity attack data in IoT 6LoWPAN networks. The efficient network architecture for all machine models is chosen based on comparing the performance of various network topologies and network scenarios.

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a cutting-edge technology that is changing human life. The rapid and widespread applications of IoT, however, make cyberspace more vulnerable, especially to IoT-based attacks in which IoT devices are used to launch attack on cyber-physical systems. Given a massive number of IoT devices (in order of billions), detecting and preventing these IoT-based attacks are critical. However, this task is very challenging due to the limited energy and computing capabilities of IoT devices and the continuous and fast evolution of attackers. Among IoT-based attacks, unknown ones are far more devastating as these attacks could surpass most of the current security systems and it takes time to detect them and ``cure'' the systems. To effectively detect new/unknown attacks, in this article, we propose a novel representation learning method to better predictively ``describe'' unknown attacks, facilitating supervised learning-based anomaly detection methods. Specifically, we develop three regularized versions of autoencoders (AEs) to learn a latent representation from the input data. The bottleneck layers of these regularized AEs trained in a supervised manner using normal data and known IoT attacks will then be used as the new input features for classification algorithms. We carry out extensive experiments on nine recent IoT datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The experimental results demonstrate that the new latent representation can significantly enhance the performance of supervised learning methods in detecting unknown IoT attacks. We also conduct experiments to investigate the characteristics of the proposed models and the influence of hyperparameters on their performance. The running time of these models is about 1.3 ms that is pragmatic for most applications.},

abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT), applications hosted on resource-limited devices interact with the user and the physical world to provide digital connectivity and automation to daily activities, and frequently provide a point of entry into networks. However, many IoT applications are vulnerable to cyber attacks that can put networks, data, and connected devices at risk. Integrity measurement is an active defense technique used to detect malicious modification of software at runtime. While its usefulness has been well-demonstrated, integrity measurement is application-dependent and requires domain knowledge of the targeted software. Currently, adding integrity measurement to a platform requires substantial human effort, and thus application has been limited to usage on widely-deployed software such as the Linux kernel. Due to the diversity of IoT, vendors are unlikely to devote a substantial amount of effort to add integrity measurement systems to their devices. In this paper we introduce MAD- IOT (Memory Anomaly Detection for the Internet of Things), an integrity measurement framework for IoT. In order to provide low-cost integrity measurement agents and software anomaly detection for IoT platforms, MAD-IOT uses a process called IMAGE: Integrity Measurement Agent GEneration. The IMAGE process uses machine learning to automatically generate integrity measurement agents for arbitrary IoT devices. We demonstrated MAD-IOT and IMAGE on a proof-of-concept testbed and evaluated its performance with supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. Our results indicate that IMAGE is highly effective in recognizing known forms of misbehavior on IoT app operations, and very promising in identifying zero-day attacks. Finally, MAD-IOT introduces minimal overhead, making it feasible to implement on systems with very limited resources.},

Many devices, once separate, can now be interacted with remotely, improving efficiency and organization. This, however, comes at the cost of rising security vulnerabilities. Vendors are competing to create and release quickly innovative connected objects, without focusing on the security issues. As a consequence, attacks involving smart devices, or targeting them, are proliferating, creating threats to user's privacy and even their physical security. Additionally, the heterogeneous technologies involved in IoT make attempts to develop protection on smart devices much harder. Most of the intrusion detection systems developed for those platforms are based on network activity. However, on many systems, intrusions cannot easily or reliably be detected from network traces. We propose a novel host-based automated framework for intrusion detection. Our work combines user space and kernel space information and machine learning techniques to detect various kinds of intrusions in smart devices. Our solution use tracing techniques to automatically get devices behavior, process this data into numeric arrays to train several machine learning algorithms, and raise alerts whenever an intrusion is found. We implemented several machine learning algorithms, including deep learning ones, to achieve high detection capabilities, while adding little overhead on the monitored devices.

abstract = {Given a scale expansion of Internet of Things for sustainable resource management in smart cities, proper design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) is critical to safeguard the future network infrastructure from intruders. With the growth of connected things, the most-widely used centralized (cloud-based) IDS often suffers from high latency and network overhead, thereby resulting in unresponsiveness to attacks and slow detection of malicious users. In this paper, we address the limitation of centralized IDS for resource-constrained devices by proposing two methods, namely semi-distributed and distributed, that combine well-performing feature extraction and selection and exploit potential fog-edge coordinated analytics. In order to distribute the computational tasks, we individually develop parallel machine-learning models corresponding to a partitioned attack dataset. In the semi-distributed case, the parallel models, running on the edge side, are applied for side-by-side feature selections, which are then followed by a single multi-layer perceptron classification running on the fog side. In the distributed case, the parallel models individually perform both the feature selection and multi-layer perceptron classification after which the outputs are combined by a coordinating edge or fog for final decision making. Based on the comparative study of existing works, the numerical results demonstrate the promise of the proposed methods, giving a comparable detection accuracy to the superior centralized IDS as well as exemplify their inherent trade-offs between the accuracy and building time performance.},

abstract = {In the fields of Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures, attack and anomaly detection are rising concerns. With the increased use of IoT infrastructure in every domain, threats and attacks in these infrastructures are also growing proportionally. In this paper the performances of several machine learning algorithms in identifying cyber-attacks (namely SYN-DOS attacks) to IoT systems are compared both in terms of application performances, and in training/application times. We use supervised machine learning algorithms included in the MLlib library of Apache Spark, a fast and general engine for big data processing. We show the implementation details and the performance of those algorithms on public datasets using a training set of up to 2 million instances. We adopt a Cloud environment, emphasizing the importance of the scalability and of the elasticity of use. Results show that all the Spark algorithms used result in a very good identification accuracy ({\textgreater}99{\%}). Overall, one of them, Random Forest, achieves an accuracy of 1. We also report a very short training time (23.22 sec for Decision Tree with 2 million rows). The experiments also show a very low application time (0.13 sec for over than 600,000 instances for Random Forest) using Apache Spark in the Cloud. Furthermore, the explicit model generated by Random Forest is very easy-to-implement using high-or low-level programming languages. In light of the results obtained, both in terms of computation times and identification performance, a hybrid approach for the detection of SYN-DOS cyber-attacks on IoT devices is proposed: the application of an explicit Random Forest model, implemented directly on the IoT device, along with a second level analysis (training) performed in the Cloud.},

abstract = {Intrusion and anomaly detection are particularly important in the time of increased vulnerability in computer networks and communication. Therefore, this research aims to detect network intrusion with the highest accuracy and fastest time. To achieve this, nine supervised machine learning algorithms were first applied to the UNSW-NB15 dataset for network anomaly detection. In addition, different attacks are investigated with different mitigation techniques that help determine the types of attacks. Once detection was done, the feature set was reduced according to existing research work to increase the speed of the model without compromising accuracy. Furthermore, seven supervised machine learning algorithms were also applied to the newly released BoT-IoT dataset with around three million network flows. The results show that the Random Forest is the best in terms of accuracy (97.9121{\%}) and Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes the fastest algorithm with 0.69 s for the UNSW-NB15 dataset. C4.5 is the most accurate one (87.66{\%}), with all the features considered to identify the types of anomalies. For BoT-IoT, six of the seven algorithms have a close to 100{\%} detection rate, except Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes.},

abstract = {Detecting intrusion in network traffic has remained a problematic task for years. Progress in the field of machine learning is paving the way for enhancing intrusion detection systems. Due to this progress intrusion detection has become an integral part of network security. Intrusion detection has achieved high detection accuracy with the help of supervised machine learning methods. A key factor in enhancing the performance of supervised classifiers is how data is augmented for training the classification model. Data in real-world networks or publicly available datasets are not always normally (Gaussian) distributed. Instead, the distributions of variables are more likely to be skewed. To achieve a high detection rate, data normalization or transformation plays an important role for machine learning-based intrusion detection systems. Several methods are available to normalize the attributes of the data before training a classification model. However, opting for the most suitable normalization technique is still a questionable task. In this paper, a statistical method is proposed that can identify the most suitable normalization method for the dataset. The normalization method identified by the proposed approach gives the highest accuracy for an intrusion detection system. To highlight the efficiency of the proposed method, five different datasets were used with two different feature selection methods. The datasets belong to both Internet of things and traditional network environments. The proposed method is also able to identify hybrid normalizations to achieve even improved intrusion detection results.},

abstract = {The application of new techniques to increase the performance of intrusion detection systems is crucial in modern data networks with a growing threat of cyber-attacks. These attacks impose a greater risk on network services that are increasingly important from a social end economical point of view. In this work we present a novel application of several deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to intrusion detection using a labeled dataset. We present how to perform supervised learning based on a DRL framework. The implementation of a reward function aligned with the detection of intrusions is extremely difficult for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) since there is no automatic way to identify intrusions. Usually the identification is performed manually and stored in datasets of network features associated with intrusion events. These datasets are used to train supervised machine learning algorithms for classifying intrusion events. In this paper we apply DRL using two of these datasets: NSL-KDD and AWID datasets. As a novel approach, we have made a conceptual modification of the classic DRL paradigm (based on interaction with a live environment), replacing the environment with a sampling function of recorded training intrusions. This new pseudo-environment, in addition to sampling the training dataset, generates rewards based on detection errors found during training. We present the results of applying our technique to four of the most relevant DRL models: Deep Q-Network (DQN), Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), Policy Gradient (PG) and Actor-Critic (AC). The best results are obtained for the DDQN algorithm. We show that DRL, with our model and some parameter adjustments, can improve the results of intrusion detection in comparison with current machine learning techniques. Besides, the classifier obtained with DRL is faster than alternative models. A comprehensive comparison of the results obtained with other machine learning models is provided for the AWID and NSL-KDD datasets, together with the lessons learned from the application of several design alternatives to the four DRL models.},

abstract = {Integration of the Internet into the entities of the different domains of human society (such as smart homes, health care, smart grids, manufacturing processes, product supply chains, and environmental monitoring) is emerging as a new paradigm called the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the ubiquitous and wide-range IoT networks make them prone to cyberattacks. One of the main types of attack is a denial of service (DoS), where the attacker floods the network with a large volume of data to prevent nodes from using the services. An intrusion detection mechanism is considered a chief source of protection for information and communications technology. However, conventional intrusion detection methods need to be modified and improved for application to the IoT owing to certain limitations, such as resource-constrained devices, the limited memory and battery capacity of nodes, and specific protocol stacks. In this paper, we develop a lightweight attack detection strategy utilizing a supervised machine learning-based support vector machine (SVM) to detect an adversary attempting to inject unnecessary data into the IoT network. The simulation results show that the proposed SVM-based classifier, aided by a combination of two or three incomplex features, can perform satisfactorily in terms of classification accuracy and detection time.},

abstract = {The proliferation in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which routinely collect sensitive information, is demonstrated by their prominence in our daily lives. Although such devices simplify and automate every day tasks, they also introduce tremendous security flaws. Current insufficient security measures employed to defend smart devices make IoT the “weakest” link to breaking into a secure infrastructure, and therefore an attractive target to attackers. This paper proposes a three layer intrusion detection system (IDS) that uses a supervised approach to detect a range of popular network based cyber-attacks on IoT networks. The system consists of three main functions: 1) classify the type and profile the normal behavior of each IoT device connected to the network; 2) identifies malicious packets on the network when an attack is occurring; and 3) classifies the type of the attack that has been deployed. The system is evaluated within a smart home testbed consisting of eight popular commercially available devices. The effectiveness of the proposed IDS architecture is evaluated by deploying 12 attacks from 4 main network based attack categories, such as denial of service (DoS), man-in-the-middle (MITM)/spoofing, reconnaissance, and replay. Additionally, the system is also evaluated against four scenarios of multistage attacks with complex chains of events. The performance of the system's three core functions result in an F-measure of: 1) 96.2{\%}; 2) 90.0{\%}; and 3) 98.0{\%}. This demonstrates that the proposed architecture can automatically distinguish between IoT devices on the network, whether network activity is malicious or benign, and detect which attack was deployed on which device connected to the network successfully.},

Besides, we propose a lightweight feature selection method, which uses a small number of features to evaluate the two functions. As a result, in the classification experiments, the proposed method automatically extracts 29 and 9 from 88 features, and then the designed system achieves a high accuracy rate of 98.7{\%} and 98.99{\%}.

There is a significant growth in the amount and complexity of Internet of Things devices that are deployed in a wider range of environments.

In this paper, we investigate and leverage effective feature selection techniques to improve intrusion detection using machine learning methods. The proposed approach is based on a centralised intrusion detection system, which uses the deep feature abstraction, feature selection and classification to train the model for detecting the malicious and anomalous actions in the traffic. The deep feature abstraction uses deep learning techniques of artificial neural network in the form of unsupervised autoencoder to construct more features for the traffic. Based on the availability of cumulative features, the system then employs a variety of wrapper-based feature selection techniques ranging from SVM and decision tree to Naive Bayes for selecting high-ranked features, which are then combined and fed into an artificial neural network classifier for distinguishing attack and normal behaviors. The experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method on Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset, which achieves high detection accuracy of up to 99.95{\%}, relatively competitive to the existing machine learning works for the same dataset.},

abstract = {Machine learning based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) allow flexible and efficient automated detection of cyberattacks in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, this has also created an additional attack vector; the machine learning models which support the IDS's decisions may also be subject to cyberattacks known as Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). In the context of IoT, AML can be used to manipulate data and network traffic that traverse through such devices. These perturbations increase the confusion in the decision boundaries of the machine learning classifier, where malicious network packets are often miss-classified as being benign. Consequently, such errors are bypassed by machine learning based detectors, which increases the potential of significantly delaying attack detection and further consequences such as personal information leakage, damaged hardware, and financial loss. Given the impact that these attacks may have, this paper proposes a rule-based approach towards generating AML attack samples and explores how they can be used to target a range of supervised machine learning classifiers used for detecting Denial of Service attacks in an IoT smart home network. The analysis explores which DoS packet features to perturb and how such adversarial samples can support increasing the robustness of supervised models using adversarial training. The results demonstrated that the performance of all the top performing classifiers were affected, decreasing a maximum of 47.2 percentage points when adversarial samples were present. Their performances improved following adversarial training, demonstrating their robustness towards such attacks.},

abstract = {The increase of connected devices and the constantly evolving methods and techniques by attackers pose a challenge for network intrusion detection systems from conception to operation. As a result, we see a constant adoption of machine learning algorithms for network intrusion detection systems. However, the dataset used by these studies has become obsolete regarding both background and attack traffic. This work describes the AB-TRAP framework that enables the use of updated network traffic and considers operational concerns to enable the complete deployment of the solution. AB-TRAP is a five-step framework consisting of ( {\$}{\{}i{\}}{\$} ) the generation of the attack dataset, (ii) the bonafide dataset, (iii) training of machine learning models, (iv) realization (implementation) of the models, and ( {\$}{\{}v{\}}{\$} ) the performance evaluation of the realized model after deployment. We exercised the AB-TRAP for local (LAN) and global (internet) environments to detect TCP port scanning attacks. The LAN study case presented an f1-score of 0.96, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.99 using a decision tree with minimal CPU and RAM usage on kernel-space. For the internet case with eight machine learning algorithms with an average f1-score of 0.95, an average area under the ROC curve of 0.98, and an average overhead of 1.4{\%} CPU and 3.6{\%} RAM on user-space in a single-board computer. This framework has the following paramount characteristics: it is reproducible, uses the most up-to-date network traffic, attacks, and addresses the concerns to the model's realization and deployment.},

With the increased use of IoT infrastructure in every domain, threats and attacks in these infrastructures are also growing commensurately. Denial of Service, Data Type Probing, Malicious Control, Malicious Operation, Scan, Spying and Wrong Setup are such attacks and anomalies which can cause an IoT system failure. In this paper, performances of several machine learning models have been compared to predict attacks and anomalies on the IoT systems accurately. The machine learning (ML) algorithms that have been used here are Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The evaluation metrics used in the comparison of performance are accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. The system obtained 99.4{\%} test accuracy for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and ANN. Though these techniques have the same accuracy, other metrics prove that Random Forest performs comparatively better.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are well-connected; they generate and consume data which involves transmission of data back and forth among various devices. Ensuring security of the data is a critical challenge as far as IoT is concerned. Since IoT devices are inherently low-power and do not require a lot of compute power, a Network Intrusion Detection System is typically employed to detect and remove malicious packets from entering the network. In the same context, we propose feature clusters in terms of Flow, Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) by using features in UNSW-NB15 data-set. We eliminate problems like over-fitting, curse of dimensionality and imbalance in the data-set. We apply supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks on the clusters. Using RF, we, respectively, achieve 98.67{\%} and 97.37{\%} of accuracy in binary and multi-class classification. In clusters based techniques, we achieved 96.96{\%}, 91.4{\%} and 97.54{\%} of classification accuracy by using RF on Flow {\&} MQTT features, TCP features and top features from both clusters. Moreover, we show that the proposed feature clusters provide higher accuracy and requires lesser training time as compared to other state-of-the-art supervised ML-based approaches.},

abstract = {The most basic feature of every smart device or endpoint device in IoT is to collect the large amount of data that is being generated and direct it to a destination server via the Internet. IoT network is vulnerable to attacks and identification of these malicious behaviours at an early stage can save the data from attacks. The main objective of this work is to build machine learning models to identify attacks in IoT network. To build a model, normal and attack data needs to be generated from the IoT environment. A test bed is build to simulate the IoT environment using Node MCU ESP8266, DHT11 sensor and wireless router. An adversarial system is build using a laptop system which performs actions of sniffing and poisoning attacks. Data captured from the sensors were temperature, humidity and due-point which are transmitted to ThinkSpeak platform using wireless gateway. In the normal phase, sensor values is captured by Node MCU and transmitted to Think Speak server which are stored and labelled as normal data. In the attacking phase, from an adversarial system, the attacker secretly intercepts the data, modifies the data when it is transmitted between the Node MCU and Think Speak server. In the attacking phase, Man in the Middle attack is performed in the network using ARP Poisoning and the data captured is labelled as attack data. Machine learning classifiers such as Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, SVM, decision tree, Adaboost are built to categorize data into normal and attack classes.},

abstract = {With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, more and more smart devices are connected to the Internet. Since these devices were designed for better connections with each other, very limited security mechanisms have been considered. It would be costly to develop separate security mechanisms for the diverse behaviors in different devices. Given new and changing devices and attacks, it would be helpful if the characteristics of diverse device types could be dynamically learned for better protection. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to device type identification through network traffic analysis for anomaly detection in IoT. Firstly, the characteristics of different device types are learned from their generated network packets using supervised learning methods. Secondly, by learning important features from selected device types, we further compare the effects of unsupervised learning methods including One-class SVM, Isolation forest, and autoencoders for dimensionality reduction. Finally, we evaluate the performance of anomaly detection by transfer learning with autoencoders. In our experiments on real data in the target factory, the best performance of device type identification can be achieved by XGBoost with an accuracy of 97.6{\%}. When adopting autoencoders for learning features from the network packets in Modbus TCP protocol, the best F1 score of 98.36{\%} can be achieved. Comparable performance of anomaly detection can be achieved when using autoencoders for transfer learning from the reference dataset in the literature to our target site. This shows the potential of the proposed approach for automatic anomaly detection in smart factories. Further investigation is needed to verify the proposed approach using different types of devices in different IoT environments.},

Especially in indoor localization environment, that is one of the most concerning topic of smart cities, internet of things and wireless sensor networks. Many technologies are being used for localization purpose in indoor environment and Wi-Fi using received signal strengths (RSSs) is one of them. Wi-Fi RSSs are sensitive to reflection, refraction, interference and channel noise that cause irregularity in signal strengths. The irregular and anomalous RSS values, used in a Wi-Fi indoor localization environment, cannot define the location of any unknown node correctly. Therefore, this research has developed an outlier detection technique named as iF{\_}Ensemble for Wi-Fi indoor localization environment by analyzing RSSs using the combination of supervised, unsupervised and ensemble machine learning methods. In this research isolation forest (iForest) is used as an unsupervised learning method. Supervised learning method includes support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest (RF) classifiers with stacking that is an ensemble learning method.

The danger exposed by infested Internet-connected Things not only affects the security of IoT but also threatens the complete Internet eco-system which can possibly exploit the vulnerable Things (smart devices) deployed as botnets. Mirai malware compromised the video surveillance devices and paralyzed Internet via distributed denial of service attacks. In the recent past, security attack vectors have evolved bothways, in terms of complexity and diversity.

This survey classifies the IoT security threats and challenges for IoT networks by evaluating existing defense techniques. Our main focus is on network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs); hence, this paper reviews existing NIDS implementation tools and datasets as well as free and open-source network sniffing software. Then, it surveys, analyzes, and compares state-of-the-art NIDS proposals in the IoT context in terms of architecture, detection methodologies, validation strategies, treated threats, and algorithm deployments. The review deals with both traditional and machine learning (ML) NIDS techniques and discusses future directions. In this survey, our focus is on IoT NIDS deployed via ML since learning algorithms have a good success rate in security and privacy. The survey provides a comprehensive review of NIDSs deploying different aspects of learning techniques for IoT, unlike other top surveys targeting the traditional systems. We believe that, this paper will be useful for academia and industry research, first, to identify IoT threats and challenges, second, to implement their own NIDS and finally to propose new smart techniques in IoT context considering IoT limitations.

abstract = {Deep autoencoding Gaussian mixture model (DAGMM) employs dimensionality reduction and density estimation and jointly optimizes them for unsupervised anomaly detection tasks. However, the absence of large amount of training data greatly compromises DAGMM's performance. Due to rising concerns for privacy, a worse situation can be expected. By aggregating only parameters from local training on clients for obtaining knowledge from more private data, federated learning is proposed to enhance model performance. Meanwhile, privacy is properly protected. Inspired by the aforementioned, this paper presents a federated deep autoencoding Gaussian mixture model (FDAGMM) to improve the disappointing performance of DAGMM caused by limited data amount. The superiority of our proposed FDAGMM is empirically demonstrated with extensive experiments.},
